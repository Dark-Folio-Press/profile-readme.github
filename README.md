# 🌙 Dark Folio Codex
Bringing Stories to Light ✨

## About

Welcome to the Codex of Dark Folio Press: a small, independent publisher exploring the intersection of **public domain works**, **original fiction**, and **digital innovation**.

### What We Publish

- 💾 **[Open Source Codex](https://github.com/orgs/Dark-Folio-Press/repositories?q=visibility%3Apublic+archived%3Afalse)**: Check Dark Folio's Repo for ongoing updates and contributions
- 📚 **Public Domain Works**: Carefully curated classics and forgotten gems from the literary past
- ✍️ **Original Fiction**: New stories inspired by the data narratives and symbolic systems we love
- ⭐ **Daily Horoscopes**: [Hot off the daily press](https://horoscopes.darkfoliopress.com) Created by our custom app, blending celestial wisdom with code

## The Development Journey

I'm on a path of continuous learning as a **self-taught, AI-assisted developer**. My codebase reflects an evolving understanding of how **symbolic systems**, **software constraints**, and **human agency** can coexist in creative harmony.


### Current Projects ###

🤖[Astro Interpretive Engine](https://github.com/Dark-Folio-Press/Astro-Interpretative-Engine)
This project is an experiment in interpretive system design: how to encode symbolic literacy, restraint, and ethical boundaries into an AI-assisted application.

☀️ [Darkfolio Daily Press](https://horoscopes.darkfoliopress.com/) 
<br>Horoscopes hot off the daily press. 
Classic zodiac readings for all 12 signs, delivered fresh every day.

🔮 [Darkfolio Personal Horoscopes](https://horoscopes.darkfoliopress.com/personal) 
<br>Calculated solely for you based on your cosmic blueprint. 
Your birth chart. Your transits. Your story.

### What if you could hear your horoscope? ###
🎧 [DEMO COPY Sonifyr](https://sonifyr.darkfoliopress.com/) 
<br>With my Spotify Developer Account I set out to answer that question and came up with [Sonifyr](https://sonifyr.darkfoliopress.com/) 
<br>**Sonifyr transforms your unique birth chart into playlists that you can feel**
<br>Calculations are by my OpenAi astro assistant: armed with a magnetic persona, and a very basic astrology program I built using python, Immanuel library, Swiss Ephemeris, kerykeon and api's.

<i>Note Ideally I would have access to the entire length of the song for a proper sonifycation session. 
Through Spotify I have a small window worth mere seconds - to protect the creative and intellectual rights of musicians, and I think more to the point, bandwidth.
I'm down for working on a full sonifycation suite, using non commercial music in the future.
In the meantime this has been an exceptionally fun project to work on. Plus, I had my mind blown over the relationship between math, music, time and geometry.</i>

## Meet the Developer
My name is Sareenah and I'm a trained data analyst, lifelong tarot reader, student of astrology and folk lore enthusiast.
Dark Folio Press is an expression of my personal journey as a curious, data informed artist, with an obsession for the enduring power of story telling.

## Philosophy
My work is guided by the belief that technology and tradition, data and storytelling, constraints and creativity aren't opposing figures, they're collaborators. Each line of code is a conversation between what was, what is, and what might be.

## On AI Agents - Personal POV
I've tried Famous and Replit for agent assistance, and stayed with Replit. 
I wrote much of the original python but required a lot of help with the web dev.
I designed the assistant's persona in openai by crafting a particular voice through a few simple, but powerful prompts.
Replit has been continuously improving, has taught me a lot personaly, and helped me get over the finish line.
I've used GitHub Co-Pilot to support me in keeping my hierarchical structure clean and structured and managing my pull requests.
As I explore these features more, I'll add my notes here
